# TreePaunchBot

Small bot for a server that I'm in.

**Features:**
  - uses the twitch api to check if anyone from the server is streaming. Sends an embed and updates roles accordingly
  - has a watchlist for people to watch out for
  - has a todo command where users can store information which they want to keep
  - automatically determines birthdays and sends a message on someone's birthday.
